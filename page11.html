                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5"><div>Emerging technologies will increasingly allow companies to exploit consumers' irrationality or vulnerability. The internet makes it that much easier to exploit emotions on a personal level and manipulate actions. On the internet, these are most often referred to as "dark patterns". Normally when you think of “bad design,” you think of the creator as being sloppy or lazy but with no ill intent. This type of bad design is known as a “UI anti-pattern.” Dark Patterns are different—they are not mistakes, they are carefully crafted with a solid understanding of human psychology, and they do not have the user’s interests in mind. We as designers, founders, UX, and UI professionals and creators need to take a stance against Dark Patterns. There are 12 types of dark patterns. They are as follows:</div><div><br></div><div>1. <strong>Trick Questions</strong></div><div>While filling in a form you respond to a question that tricks you into giving an answer you didn't intend. When glanced upon quickly the question appears to ask one thing, but when read carefully it asks another thing entirely.</div><div><br></div><br><div>2. <strong>Sneak into basket</strong></div><div>You attempt to purchase something, but somewhere in the purchasing journey the site sneaks an additional item into your basket, often through the use of an opt-out radio button or checkbox on a prior page. These buttons or checkboxes are mislabeled to sneak in items.</div><div><br></div><br><div>3. <strong>Roach Motel</strong></div><div>You get into a situation very easily, but then you find it is hard to get out of it (e.g. a premium subscription).</div><div><br></div><br><div>4. <strong>Privacy Zuckerberg</strong></div><div>You are tricked into publicly sharing more information about yourself than you really intended to. Named after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</div><div><br></div><br><div>5. <strong>Price comparison prevention</strong></div><div>The retailer makes it hard for you to compare the price of an item with another item, so you cannot make an informed decision.</div><div><br></div><br><div>6. <strong>Misdirection</strong></div><div>The design purposefully focuses your attention on one thing in order to distract your attention from another.</div><div><br></div><br><div>7. <strong>Hidden Costs</strong></div><div>You get to the last step of the checkout process, only to discover some unexpected charges have appeared, e.g. delivery charges, tax, etc.</div><div><br></div><br><div>8. <strong>Bait and Switch</strong></div><div>You set out to do one thing, but a different, undesirable thing happens instead.</div><div><br></div><br><div>9. <strong>Confirmshaming</strong></div><div>The act of guilting the user into opting into something. The option to decline is worded in such a way as to shame the user into compliance.</div><div><br></div><br><div>10. <strong>Disguised ads</strong></div><div>Adverts that are disguised as other kinds of content or navigation, in order to get you to click on them.</div><div><br></div><br><div>11. <strong>Forced Continuity</strong></div><div>When your free trial with a service comes to an end and your credit card silently starts getting charged without any warning. In some cases this is made even worse by making it difficult to cancel the membership.</div><div><br></div><br><div>12. <strong>Friend Spam</strong></div><div>The product asks for your email or social media permissions under the pretence it will be used for a desirable outcome (e.g. finding friends), but then spams all your contacts in a message that claims to be from you.</div><div><br></div><div>You must be weary of these sneaky dark patterns because they exist on almost every website. Even Google is not righteous. They disguise ads and put an arrow button on blogs so you think it will take you to the next page but actually, it is a subtle ad.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Ethics issues in advertising are nothing new. Any advertising history book will show you how messed up the tactics used to manipulate readers were. However, deceptive copywriting still exists on the internet, and it's much easier to get away with it. Here are three very specific copywriting manipulations that are rarely discussed:</div><div><br></div><div>1. <strong>Testimonials</strong></div><div>Not all testimonials are actually real. Testimonials work more often than not in A/B tests, but they’re not all done ethically. When testimonials are genuine or appear to be genuine, they increase the credibility of your offer by leveraging social proof. Fake or embellished testimonials are more common than you might think. Keep your eyes peeled for that.</div><div><br></div><br><div>2. <strong>False Scarcity</strong></div><div>In online marketing, creating a false sense of scarcity is a common strategy. It's also aggravating, and it can clearly backfire if the customer notices. It is basically when you pretend that there is a scarcity of something when there actually isn’t. An example of this is a salesperson telling you that a service has a monthly pay as you go system but they are sold out. They will then tell you that they still have a yearly option so you will instead be hooked in for a year and will be wasting money.</div><div><br></div><br><div>3. <strong>The Damning Admission</strong></div><div>This is a common one in infomarketing, but it's been used in other fields as well. Essentially, the damning admission is intended to lower the consumer's guard and make your offer appear more genuine and credible. Just before making a claim that you want people to believe, you admit something negative about your product. By demonstrating your willingness to show your product in its true light, you gain credibility, and the prospect is more likely to believe your positive claim. Of course, this technique can be used either to shine a more perfect light on the truth (to help people accept a true but exceptional claim that would usually be received with skepticism), or to manipulate people into accepting a false claim). Your intent may guide your decision to use the technique or not, but it’s the truth or falsehood of the claim that determines whether it’s persuasive or manipulative. The damning admission isn’t always unethical. Most of the time it’s an example of truly and authentically describing your product. But when one employs the strategy in order to legitimize a false claim that follows, it’s an example of blackhat copywriting.</div><div><br></div><div>The power of defaults is something most people don’t know about. The top option is almost always chosen by users (even when the top two options switch places). This leads to the conclusion that in online decision-making, users overwhelmingly choose the default option. Many businesses take advantage of this. On Google, companies use a Black Hat SEO technique called paid links. A company pays for a link to appear higher to increase traffic. Websites also put a more expensive option first and the cheaper of free/opt out option lower so you might not choose it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There is also something called negative options. Consumers often don't realize there is a pre-checked box that authorizes future charges. Consumers must un-click or opt-out of pre- checked terms and conditions or payment authorization box. Cancelling can be complicated by merchants with poor customer service, slow response times, and untimely refunds. For free trials with a negative option feature, a company takes a consumer's failure to cancel as permission to continue billing.&nbsp;</div><br><div><strong>Takeaways:</strong></div><br><div>Emerging technologies will increasingly allow companies to exploit consumers' irrationality or vulnerability. These are often referred to as "dark patterns" and are designed with no ill intent. We as designers, founders, UX, and UI professionals and creators need to take a stance against Dark Patterns. There are 12 types of dark patterns, including trick questions, bait, diversion, deception, and hidden costs. The author recommends these 12 design types in his talk on "Designing for Customers" on Tuesday, February 14 at 10pm GMT.  Forced Continuity makes it difficult to cancel membership. Product asks for your email or social media permissions under the pretence it will be used for a desirable outcome. Then spams all your contacts in a message that claims to be from you.
